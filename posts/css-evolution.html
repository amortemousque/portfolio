        When the web started, layouts looked like this article. A single page
        with text and images following the only top-down flow available. Design
        choices was around backgrounds and text colors.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Table era</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Tables came along</strong> bringing two dimensional layouts. It
        was a huge step forward which unleashed creativity on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the reasons is that <strong>design conventions</strong> on the
        web didn't exist yet. Everything had to be invented. In fact, what we
        call conventions are practices that stays over time but we can hardly
        predict when they happened. For instance, no one is able to tell how and
        when navbar and sidebar became navigation layout conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason for this creativity was the absence of screen sizes
        constraint. Back at that time, we had no smartphones, no tablets and
        almost all computers shared the same screen size. This mean, you were
        sure our visual didn't break.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, one of the major issue lies in the mix between visual styling
        and the content which made our page style impossible to redesign and
        also impossible to reuse. In this context, CSS came out.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Hard coded float layouts era</h2>
      <p>
        CSS was invented to separate the content from the visual style, given us
        a lot of advantages among reusability, accessibility and SEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS did not provide a powerful layout model nevertheless,
        <strong>float</strong> did the job for a while. At the same time, the
        complexity caused by the arrival of new devices and screens, was
        growing. With it, the need of a reliable
        <strong>responsive design</strong> became a necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem was, Float wasn't designed to be used like we did. We ended
        up playing with percentage to create multi column layouts. Lots of math
        had to be done in order to align elements and the support of older
        browser was a nightmare. Even with the best intentions, layouts lacked
        of reliability and consistency. Therefore people started to lose
        confidence in CSS and concluded <strong>CSS wasn't enough.</strong>
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">CSS frameworks era</h2>
      <p>
        In this context, <strong>CSS frameworks came along</strong>, and with
        them the idea of <strong>grids</strong>. The 12 column grid layout was
        one of the most famous ones. The idea is to define a container of a
        specific dimension and to split it into 12 columns. Finally, helper
        classes allowed you to place your content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frameworks took away the burden of responsiveness and did the math for
        you. Websites heavily used them to get rid of layout headaches. But it
        came with a price. Layout standardization took away creativity, not to
        mention that we had to learn another tool in order to create layouts for
        the web.
      </p>
      <picture
        ><img
          style="
            min-width: 100%;
            margin-block-start: 2rem;
            margin-block-end: 2rem;
          "

          alt="Timeline of css layout"
      /></picture>
      <div class="statement">
        <span class="statement-title">Statement</span>
        <p>
          <strong>Standardization took away creativity</strong>. A large
          majority of the web follows the same layout patterns, which has been
          even enforced by the misusage of <strong>design systems</strong>. Of
          corse, best practices and industrialization are very important and
          we've seen lot of improvements in term of user experience. But lots of
          misguidance came along the way. And people started to use these tools
          by default without understanding what tradeoffs they imply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at
          <a
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=newspaper+layout&tbm=isch"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >newspaper layouts</a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://www.google.com/search?q=magazine+layout&tbm=isch"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener"
            >magazine layouts</a
          >
          . Every pages takes care of choosing the right layout for right
          content. Newspapers and magazines use layouts to emphases the content
          and to make it attractive. They wants their readers to enjoy the
          reading experience through the content and the visual. For instance,
          this article, like 90% of the web is a perfect counterexample. Our
          brain is still formatted by our experience with CSS frameworks.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="title">The future of layouts</h2>
      <p>
        Lots of new features have been rolled out in CSS this recent years,
        empowering developers and designers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS Grid</li>
        <li>Flexbox</li>
        <li>CSS logical properties</li>
        <li>Multicolumn</li>
        <li>Viewport Unit</li>
        <li>Transformations</li>
        <li>CSS Shapes</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Among them, we can find Flexbox, CSS Grid and Viewport Unit. I suggest
        you to check them out. There is a tremendous amount of good articles
        about them on the web. All of these features are reliable and consistent
        across browsers. The web isn't stiff anymore.
      </p>
