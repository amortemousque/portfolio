                <strong>Hi! I’m Aymeric Mortemousque</strong>
                Experience software engineer curious about various computer science topics. I love to learn technologies
                and solving complex challenges with them. My favorite subjects are often around frontend development and user experiences.
                Thus, I’m often busy working on side projects for curiosity or to help people close to me. 
                I've tried to gather recent side-projects. Some may pick your attention?
