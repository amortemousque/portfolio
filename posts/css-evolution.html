      <h1 class="headline">Web design evolution with CSS</h1>
      <picture class="cover"
        ><img src="../assets/images/posts/web-design-evolution.jpg" alt=""

      <p>
        When the web started, layouts looked like this article. A single page with text and images
        following the only top-down flow available with the only comfort of background and text
        colors.
      </p>
      <h2 class="project-title">Table era</h2>
      <p>
        Then <strong>tables came along</strong>. It was a huge step forward. Now, you were able to
        organize your page in a two dimensional way. Tables unleashed creativity on the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the reasons is that <strong>design conventions</strong> on the web did not exist, so
        everything had to be invented. Things that we call convention are just practices that stays
        over time. For instance, no one is able to tell who and when navbar and sidebar became
        navigation layout conventions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason for this creativity was the absence of one big constraint. I'm talking about
        screen sizes. Back at that time they were no smartphone, no tablet and almost all computers
        shared the same screen size. Without this constraint you were sure your visual didn't break.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, one of the major problems was that the visual styling and the content were twisted
        together and that made your page impossible to redesign and also impossible to reuse your
        style. In this context, CSS came out.
      </p>
      <h2 class="project-title">Hard coded float layouts era</h2>
      <p>
        CSS was invented to separate the content from the visual style, given us a lot of advantages
        among reusability, accessibility and SEO.
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS did not provide a powerful layout model nevertheless, <strong>float</strong> did the job
        for a while. At the same time, the complexity caused by the arrival of new devices and
        screens, was growing. With it, the need of a reliable
        <strong>responsive design</strong> became a necessity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem was, Float wasn't designed to be used like we did and we ended up playing with
        percentage to create multi column layouts. Lots of math had to be done in order to align
        elements, in addition to this the support of older browser was a nightmare. Even with the
        best intentions our layouts lacked of reliability. So people started to lose confidence in
        CSS and concluded <strong>CSS wasn't enough.</strong>
      </p>
      <h2 class="project-title">CSS frameworks era</h2>
      <p>
        That's why, <strong>CSS frameworks came along</strong>, and with them the idea of
        <strong>grids</strong>. The 12 column grid layout was one of the most famous ones. This idea
        is to split your screen in 960px width container split in 12 columns. Frameworks took away
        the burden of responsiveness and did the math for you. You can now organize your elements
        and to be sure your design won't break. Websites heavily used them to get rid of layout
        headaches. But it came with a price. Standardization has removed creativity not to mention
        that we have to learn another tool in order to create layout for the web.
      </p>
      <picture
        ><img
          style="min-width: 100%; margin-block-start: 2rem; margin-block-end: 2rem"
          src="../assets/images/posts/css-layout-timeline.svg"
          alt=""
      /></picture>
      <div class="statement">
        <span class="statement-title">Statement</span>
        <p>
          <strong>Standardization has removed creativity</strong>. A large majority of the web
          follows the same layout patterns, which has been even enforced by the misusage of
          <strong>design systems</strong>. Of corse, best practices and industrialization are very
          important. But lots us use these tools without understanding their philosophy and what
          tradeoffs they imply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take a look at
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=newspaper+layout&tbm=isch">newspaper layouts</a>.
          Every pages has it's own layout wish depend on what content it displays. Newspapers use
          layouts to emphases the content and to make it attractive. They wants their readers to
          enjoy the reading experience through the content and the visual. The complete opposite of
          this boring article.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="project-title">The future of layouts</h2>
      <p>
        Lots of new features have been rolled out in CSS this recent years, empowering developer and
        designer. I strongly believe these features bring back the creativity I talked earlier.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>CSS Grid</li>
        <li>Flexbox</li>
        <li>ALlignment</li>
        <li>Writing modes</li>
        <li>Multicolumn</li>
        <li>Viewport Unit</li>
        <li>Transformations</li>
        <li>Object Fit</li>
        <li>Clip path</li>
        <li>Masking</li>
        <li>Initial-letter</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        CSS Logical Properties introduces a new set of properties intended to replace CSS physical
        properties. Traditionally css uses physical properties to describe boxes: "width", "height",
        "margin-top", "border-left" and so on. CSS Logical Properties are relative to the flow.
