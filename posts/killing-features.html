      <p>
        Killing features is a crucial part of software development. Over time,
        features can creep your project and hide the core value proposition of
        your product. You need discipline and methodology to scope your project
        and decide whether to keep or kill features.
      </p>
      <strong>Retiring features is as much important as adding them.</strong>.
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "A great product is one that solves the customer’s problem in the
          simplest way possible. Great products deliver value, not features." —
          Grant Ammons
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That might sounds like common sense but creating a simple and intuitive
        product is hard. If you find a product simple, it's probably because
        killing features is a part of their concerns.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Feature creep</h2>
      <p>
        It was David Pogue who brought it into the spotlight back in 2006. To
        illustrate he took a screen shot of Microsoft Word with all the
        available menus.
      </p>
      <picture>
        <img
          src="../assets/images/posts/feature-creep.png"

      <p>
        It confronts how complicated the product really is. Knowing all the
        options would take ages, not to mention the visual stress if you were to
        use many options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Market, business strategy, user behaviours and technologies impact a
        product. Because of these changes, the product we first envision to
        solve a specific need start to grow, extending the scope. As the time
        goes, we add more and more requirements and features to the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any additional feature added to the product increase the learning curve,
        put stress on navigation and ultimately work against the user.
      </p>

      <h2 class="title">Controlling the scope</h2>
      <p>
        Defining boundaries and maintaining a cohesive vision, is one of the
        hardest things to do with product development. CEO vision, inventors,
        acquisitions, new markets are among many business actions that may
        impact a product boundaries. Where lots of companies see the opportunity
        to embrace new features while expanding the product scope, few are
        willing to kill features while reducing that same scope.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        "The dilution effect is why maintaining a clear vision for your product
        is so important. Without a clear understanding of the limits and
        boundaries of your product, the product will morph into something you no
        longer recognize. Or worse, something you can no longer manage or
        control." — Jason Fried
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Inherited from the development phase, the backlog is observed
        chronologically. New feature feels more appealing than older ones. The
        bad news is, older features are the core value proposition of the
        product. You have to see your product as a set of features and control
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features on the backlog need the same level of scrutiny, or higher. Any
        increase in the surface area of a product is a potential dilution of the
        value proposition and the overall experience.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Don't lose sight of the product promise.</strong></p>

          >How to manage user needs that fall out of our boundaries but can add
          value to the users?</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer this question we need to clarify what being "user oriented"
        means and how to gather real needs.<br />
        A common misconception about being "user oriented" is to think that
        interviewing users and answering to there needs with new features is the
        solution. Gathering needs only through interview will lead you to what's
        Ian Batterbee called "feature-led experiences".
        <strong>Users are not good at expressing theirs needs</strong>.
        Observation and data is key when it comes to understand you users.
      </p>
      <h2 class="title">Be data driven</h2>
      <p>
        In order for your product to deliver value, you need to build a
        framework to review objectively features. Gathering usage data on every
        feature is a key step to success. We need metrics thar are clear
        indications of success/failure of a feature. Here, I'm only gonna scrape
        the surface of two well known systems:

      <ul>
        <li>Dave McClure's AARRR Framework Metrics</li>
        <li>Google’s HEART Framework</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="subheading">McClure's AARRR Framework Metrics</h3>
      <p>
        10 years ago David McClure Dave whose an angel invertor, a venture
        capitalism and a founder of startups created the AARRR framework. He
        created this framework to measure a startup gross using 5 key
        performance indicators.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Acquisitions — <em>How do customers find you?</em></h4>
        <p>
          Which channel: Most traffic? / Best conversion rate? / Best cost per
          acquisition?
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Activation —
          <em>How quickly can you get your customer's to the 'Aha-Moment'?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          This is when the user sees the value of your product. Find this moment
          thanks to customer interview and metrics.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>for apps, that can be after people download / sign up</li>
          <li>for e-commerce, it could be the number of orders.</li>
          <li>for SaaS, sign up for your trial</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Retention —
          <em
            >How many of your customers are you retaining & why are you losing
            the others.</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          Make sure your churn rate is smaller than your customer acquisitions.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            for apps, that can be measured following your daily or monthly
            active users.
          </li>
          <li>for e-commerce, it could be the number of orders.</li>
          <li>for SaaS, renewing the monthly subscription.</li>
        </ul>
        Don't forget that it's 5 to 25 times more expensive to acquire a new
        customer than to sell to an existing one.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Referral —
          <em>How can you turn your customers into your advocates</em>
        </h4>
        Keep an eye on the Net Promoter Score and Viral Coefficient.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Revenue —
          <em>How can you increase revenue</em>
        </h4>
      </section>
      <br />
      <p>
        Make sure that while building your app and add more feature, you look at
        those metrics to see the impact. You have to identify which metrics your
        feature is targeted to define whether it is a success or a failure.
      </p>
      <h3 class="subheading">Google's HEART Framework</h3>
      <p>
        HEART metrics are especially build to measure UX metric. We can see them
        as a lower level of dataset compared to AARRR.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Happiness — <em>How do users feel about your product?</em></h4>
        Happiness is typically measured by user satisfaction surveys, app
        ratings and reviews, and net promoter score.
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          <strong>Engagement</strong> —
          <em>How often are people coming back to use the product? </em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Engagement can be measured by number of visits per user per week,
          session length, or a key action, like the number of photos uploaded or
          songs listened to per user per day.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          <strong>Adoption</strong> —
          <em
            >How many people complete the onboarding process and become regular
            users?</em
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          Adoption is measured by number of new users over a period of time or
          percentage of customers using a new feature.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Retention —
          <em>What percentage of users are returning to the product?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>Retention is measured by churn.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>
          Task success —
          <em>Can users achieve their goal or task quickly and easily?</em>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Task success is measured by factors like efficiency (how long it takes
          users to complete the task) effectiveness (percent of tasks
          completed), and error rate.
        </p>
      </section>
      <br />
      <p>
        Theses frameworks are very important to objectify the success of your
        product / features. Being data driven saves you from emotional decisions
        and sentiments. If all the team is aligned with the goals, you're likely
        to keep a high level of engagement even if you need to kill features.
